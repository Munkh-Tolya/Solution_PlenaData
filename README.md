Coding assessment of Plena Data by Munkh Tolya

I appreciate for reviewing my coding assessment for software engineer.
Therefore I have made this solution using Java and IntelliJ. 

Here are things you can do: 

1. Firstly clone the repository.
2. If you have a IntelliJ idea, open the project from you idea. If don't, create new java project from your idea and copy the Main.java code into your project.
3. Then Run the Main.java and write some string in the console. Then you will see the result.

Thank you for your attention!
